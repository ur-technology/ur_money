    <h2>Welcome to UR Money</h2>
    <p>
      Youâ€™re just a few steps away from claiming your free 2,000 UR!
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to provide a safe environment, we ask all community members
      to verify their identity. To do this, we will need to ask you for
      several pieces of identifying information including mobile
      phone number, name, address, date of birth, etc., and then share this
      info with Trulioo, Inc., a Canada-based identity verification service.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will also need to import your contacts so you can invite them, chat
      with them and send them UR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you give UR Technology (the maker of UR Money) permission to share
      your identity info with Trulioo, Inc. and to import your contacts?
