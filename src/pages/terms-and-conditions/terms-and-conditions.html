                  <h2>PART 1: GENERAL USE</h2>
                  <h3>1. Basic UR Technology Services.</h3>
                  <p><b>1.1. Eligibility.</b> To be eligible to use the Services, you must be at least 16 years old.
                    <br />
                    <b>1.2. UR Technology Services.</b> The UR digital currency network (“UR Network”) is an independent, decentralized, blockchain-based network where users may store and use the cryptographic digital currency “UR”. UR Technology has
                    created various mechanisms to facilitate the convenient connection to the UR Network. The term “UR Technology Services” encompasses the following items: a) a mobile application that allow users to track and/or connect with the UR digital
                    currency network in order to transfer their holdings of Digital Currency (“Mobile App”), b) various internet-accessible technical processes that are used by the Mobile App or the UR Technology website and operated by UR Technology,
                    such as user profile storage, a system for relaying messages among the Mobile App users, and others, and c) any other mobile applications, web-based applications or API’s that UR Technology creates in the future which facilitate the
                    connecting users of Digital Currency conveniently to the UR Network. UR Technology Services do NOT include the UR Network, which is a peer-to-peer network operated by miners and users who are independent of and not affiliated with
                    UR Technology. For more information on the UR Network please see https://github.com/ur-technology/go-ur. The risk of loss in trading or holding Digital Currency can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading
                    or holding Digital Currency is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.</p>
                  <h2>2. Creating an User Account.</h2>
                  <p><b>2.1. Creation of User Account.</b> In order to use any of the UR Technology Services, you must first create a User Account by providing your name, address and other identifying information, and affirming your acceptance of this Agreement.
                    UR Technology may, in our sole discretion, refuse to allow you to establish an User Account. Note that your User Account does not contain any digital currency or other financial assets or any related cryptographic private keys. The
                    management of your Digital Currency assets and any associated cryptographic private keys is entirely your responsibility.
                    <br />
                    <b>2.2. Identity Verification.</b> In order to use certain features of the UR Technology Services, including certain transfers of digital and/or local currency, you may be required to provide UR Technology with certain personal information,
                    including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number. In submitting this or any other personal information as may be required,
                    you verify that the information is accurate and authentic, and you agree to update UR Technology if any information changes. You hereby authorize UR Technology to, directly or through third parties, make any inquiries we consider necessary
                    to verify your identity and/or protect against fraud, including to query identity information contained in public reports (e.g., your name, address, past addresses, or date of birth), and to take action we reasonably deem necessary
                    based on the results of such inquiries and reports. You further authorize any and all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests.
                    <br />
                    <b>2.3 Publishing Information to the UR Network.</b> You authorize UR Technology directly or through third parties to publish to the UR Network information regarding the verification of your identity including, but not limited to,
                    a) the UR Network addresses associated with your User Account, b) the result (&#8220;verified&#8221; or &#8220;not verified&#8221;) of identity verification procedures, c) the time your identity verification procedure result was obtained,
                    and d) the UR Network address of the individual who referred you to UR Technology.</p>
                  <h2>3. Mobile App.</h2>
                  <p><b>3.1. In General.</b> The Mobile App allows you to send Digital Currency to third parties and to request and receive Digital Currency from third parties pursuant to instructions you provide to the Mobile App. The ability to send Digital
                    Currency may be disabled when not permitted by the mobile application platform provider (e.g., Apple, Inc.).
                    <br /> UR Technology reserves the right to refuse to facilitate any Digital Currency Transaction as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order or to enforce transaction limits. UR Technology
                    cannot reverse a Digital Currency Transaction which has been broadcast to a Digital Currency network.
                    <br />
                    <b>3.2. Digital Currency Transactions.</b> The Mobile App does not process Digital Currency Transactions themselves but merely facilitates the signing of transactions by the user and forwarding of transactions to the Digital Currency
                    network. Once a Digital Transaction has been signed and sent by the user it cannot be reversed, even if entered in error. UR Technology is not responsible for any loss of Digital Currency, whether arising from error on the user’s part
                    or a malfunction or design flaw in the Mobile App, software, or procedures created by UR Technology or its vendors or partners.
                    <br />
                    <b>3.3. Third Party Payments.</b> UR Technology has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including
                    other users of UR Technology Services). UR Technology is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you may transact with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with
                    any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with Digital Currency transferred using the UR Technology Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must resolve the dispute directly
                    with that third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify UR Technology Support at support@ur.technology
                    so that we may consider what action to take, if any.
                    <br />
                    <b>3.4 Advanced Protocols.</b> We do not currently support metacoins, colored coins, DAO tokens, reputation tokens, other tokens or any advanced protocol which supplements or interacts with any Digital Currency Protocol. UR Technology
                    does not detect whether transactions associated with your User Account involve any such use. Do not use your User Account to effect any instruction or transfer involving an advanced protocol. UR Technology is not responsible for any
                    loss which may result from such use nor is it responsible for allocation or transfer of any gain associated with such use.</p>
                  <h2>4. General Use, Prohibited Use, and Termination.</h2>
                  <p><b>4.1. Limited License.</b> We grant you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license, subject to the terms of this Agreement, to access and use the UR Technology Site, UR Technology Mobile App, and related content, materials, information

                    <br />
                    <b>4.3. Third-Party Applications.</b> If, to the extent permitted by UR Technology from time to time, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your User Account, either through the third party&#8217;s product
                    or service or through the UR Technology Content, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement. You are fully
                    responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with access to your User Account. Further, you acknowledge and agree that you will not hold UR Technology responsible for, and will indemnify UR Technology from, any liability

                    User Account on the Mobile App and updating your settings or by contacting our support team via e-mail at support@ur.technology
                    <br />
                    <b>4.4. Prohibited Use.</b> In connection with your use of the UR Technology Services, and your interactions with other users, and third parties you agree and represent you will not engage in any Prohibited Business or Prohibited Use
                    defined herein (see Appendix 1). We reserve the right at all times to monitor, review, retain and/or disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, sanctions programs, legal process or governmental
                    request. We reserve the right to cancel and/or suspend your User Account if it is associated with a Prohibited Use and/or a Prohibited Business, or while we are investigating such an association.
                    <br />
                    <b>4.5. Transactions Limits.</b> The use of all UR Technology Services may be subject to a limit on the amount of volume, stated in U.S. Dollar terms, you may transact or transfer in a given period (e.g., daily). To view any applicable
                    limits, visit the settings page of the Mobile App.. Your transaction limits may vary depending verification steps you have completed and other factors. UR Technology reserves the right to change applicable limits as we deem necessary
                    in our sole discretion. If you wish to raise your limits beyond the posted amounts, you may submit a request to support@ur.technology. We may require you to submit additional information about yourself or your business, provide records,
                    and arrange for meetings with UR Technology staff (such process, &#8220;Enhanced Due Diligence&#8221;). UR Technology reserves the right to charge you costs and fees associated with Enhanced Due Diligence, provided that we notify you
                    in advance of any such charges accruing. In our sole discretion, we may refuse to raise your limits or we may lower your limits at a subsequent time even if you have completed Enhanced Due Diligence.
                    <br />
                    <b>4.6. Suspension, Termination, and Cancellation.</b> UR Technology may: (a) suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the UR Technology Services, and/or (b) deactivate or cancel your User Account if:
                    <br /> · We are so required by a facially valid subpoena, court order, or binding order of a government authority; or
                    <br /> · We reasonably suspect you of using your User Account in connection with a Prohibited Use or Business (see Appendix 1); or
                    <br /> · Use of your User Account is subject to any pending litigation, investigation, or government proceeding and/or we perceive a heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with your Account activity; or
                    <br /> · Our service partners are unable to support your use; or
                    <br /> · You take any action that UR Technology deems as circumventing UR Technology&#8217;s controls, including, but not limited to, opening multiple User Accounts or abusing promotions which UR Technology may offer from time to time.
                    <br /> If UR Technology suspends or closes your User Account, or terminates your use of UR Technology Services for any reason, we will provide you with notice of our actions unless a court order or other legal process prohibits UR
                    Technology from providing you with such notice. You acknowledge that UR Technology&#8217;s decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to, suspending, or closing your User Account, may be based on confidential criteria
                    that are essential to UR Technology&#8217;s risk management and security protocols. You agree that UR Technology is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management and security procedures to you.
                    <br /> You will be permitted to use the Mobile App (or another mechanism that we may provide) to transfer Digital Currency or funds associated with your User Account for ninety (90) days after Account deactivation or cancellation unless
                    such transfer is otherwise prohibited (i) under the law, including but not limited to applicable sanctions programs, or (ii) by a facially valid subpoena or court order. You may cancel your User Account at any time by withdrawing all
                    balances and notifying UR Technology at support@ur.technology.
                    <br />
                    <b>4.7. Relationship of the Parties.</b> UR Technology is an independent contractor for all purposes. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or is intended to be deemed, nor shall it cause, you and UR Technology to be treated as

                    <br />
                    <b>4.8. Privacy of Others; Marketing.</b> If you receive information about another user through the UR Technology Services, you must keep the information confidential and only use it in connection with the UR Technology Services. You
                    may not disclose or distribute a user&#8217;s information to a third party or use the information except as reasonably necessary to effectuate a transaction and other functions reasonably incidental thereto such as support, reconciliation
                    and accounting unless you receive the user&#8217;s express consent to do so. You may not send unsolicited email to a user through the UR Technology Services.

                    (such as your mobile phone’s SMS messages) that you use to access the UR Technology Services. Any loss or compromise of the foregoing information and/or your personal information may result in unauthorized access to your User Account
                    by third-parties and the loss or theft of any Digital Currency and/or funds held in your User Account and any associated accounts, including your linked bank account(s) and credit card(s). You are responsible for keeping your email
                    address and telephone number up to date in your Account Profile in order to receive any notices or alerts that we may send you. We assume no responsibility for any loss that you may sustain due to compromise of account login credentials
                    due to no fault of UR Technology and/or failure to follow or act on any notices or alerts that we may send to you.
                    <br />
                    <b>4.10. Taxes.</b> It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct through the UR Technology Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct
                    amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Your transaction history is available through your User Account.</p>

                    <b>5.2. Arbitration; Waiver of Class Action.</b> If you have a dispute with UR Technology, we will attempt to resolve any such disputes through our support team.<strong> If we cannot resolve the dispute through our support team, you and we agree that any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association&#8217;s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules) and you and UR Technology hereby expressly waive trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</strong>                    The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator may award any relief
                    that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys&#8217; fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone
                    and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys&#8217; fees.
                    <br /> If the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise
                    have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator&#8217;s rules or applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each Party will be responsible
                    for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the Party may incur. If a court decides that any provision of this section 8.2 is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the other parts of this section
                    8.2 shall still apply. In any case, the remainder of this User Agreement, will continue to apply.</p>
                  <h2>6. General Provisions.</h2>
                  <p><b>6.1. Computer Viruses.</b> We shall not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses, spyware, scareware, Trojan horses, worms or other malware that may affect your computer or other
                    equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack. We advise the regular use of a reputable and readily available virus screening and prevention software. You should also be aware that SMS and email services are vulnerable to spoofing
                    and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from UR Technology. Always log into your User Account through the UR Technology Site to review any transactions or required actions if you have
                    any uncertainty regarding the authenticity of any communication or notice.

                    directors, agents, joint venturers, employees and representatives from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. You agree
                    to indemnify and hold UR Technology, its affiliates and Service Providers, and each of its or their respective officers, directors, agents, joint venturers, employees and representatives, harmless from any claim or demand (including
                    attorneys&#8217; fees and any fines, fees or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of or related to (i) your breach of this Agreement, (ii) your use of UR Technology Services, including the Developer&#8217;s Tools,
                    or (iii) your violation of any law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any third party.
